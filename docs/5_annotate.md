After all the setup steps, we can now begin annotating samples. Depending on which type of dataset we chose, we could 
review/annotate either documents or sentences. Simply click the button of the correct annotation type.

**Note:** SmartAnno is still under development, errors during annotating will sometimes happen. However, you can 
always restart the program to continue annotating.
