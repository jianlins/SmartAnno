CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (last
CD4 count 42 and a viral load of 65,000), cirrhosis,
diabetes, and hypothyroidism presented with eight days of
fevers to 104, chills, shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on
exertion, and fatigue.

The patient states she has become progressively dyspneic to
the point where she is short of breath with speaking.  She
has also had night sweats for the past two days and whitish
sputum.  She complains of myalgias.  No recent ill contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] known tuberculosis exposure.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially 96% on
room air, with a respiratory rate of 20, and a heart rate of
117.  A chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial opacities.
She received 3 liters of normal saline, clindamycin, and
primaquine for likely Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  She
spiked a temperature to 102.1 and became progressively
dyspneic with her respiratory rate increasing to 40, and her
oxygen saturations dropping to 89% on room air.  She was
placed on 6 liters by nasal cannula, and an arterial blood
gas showed 7.47/28/74.  The patient was given prednisone and
aztreonam for possible cholangitis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Human immunodeficiency virus diagnosed in [**3383**]; acquired
from her ex-husband (in [**3398-10-31**], CD4 count was 42 and
viral load was 65,000).
2.  Cirrhosis; status post liver biopsy in [**3398-10-31**]
consistent with cytosis and sinusoidal fibrosis consistent
with toxic metabolic disease possibly from highly active
antiretroviral therapy.
3.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus since [**3398-10-31**].
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**3398-12-1**] was normal
with no varices.

4.  Diflucan 200 mg twice per day.
5.  Videx 400 mg once per day.
6.  Zantac 150 mg once per day.
7.  Klonopin as needed.
8.  Lantus 6 units subcutaneously in the morning; no
sliding-scale.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN and SULFA DRUGS (cause a rash).

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her son. She
quit tobacco five years ago.  No alcohol.  No illicit drugs.
No intravenous drug use.  No transfusions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
patient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,
her respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,
and her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6
liters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She
was unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was
cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was
supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax
revealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were
no murmurs.  The abdomen revealed mild diffuse tenderness to
percussion, hepatomegaly 6 cm below the costal margin, no
spleen palpated, positive bowel sounds.  There was no rebound
or guarding.  Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.
Pulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was [**6-5**] in all
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
a white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%
lymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were
within normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a
creatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,
her alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase
was 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct
bilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was
negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive
for 30 protein.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia; unchanged from [**3395**].

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in
the left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia or viral pneumonia.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.
No gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 328**] Intensive Care Unit secondary
to respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a
respectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with
possible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.

Given her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was
started on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage
with primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on
prednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her
low PAO2.

In the [**Hospital Ward Name 328**] Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed
with 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears
were negative.

The patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her
medication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to
saturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on
primaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of
antibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.

2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from
admission from [**4-2**] and [**4-3**] grew out
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ([**5-7**] blood
cultures).  At that time, the patient was started on
vancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood
cultures.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out
endocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;
although, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her
peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent
surveillance blood cultures from [**4-4**] on were negative,
and the patient was to be continued on vancomycin
intravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood
cultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient
remained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.

3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class
cirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in [**3398-10-31**].  Her
cirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active
antiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 491**]
in [**3399-5-2**] for a visit.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the
patient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and
was within normal limits.

4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was
restarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen
on hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these
medications without any problems.  She was also continued on
acyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19797**] in clinic over the next two
weeks.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on
original regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary
to her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated
while in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her
Lantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the
morning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with
improved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units
of Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the
next three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which
time her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,
and her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.

6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
Levoxyl.

7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter
line was placed on [**3399-4-6**] for intravenous antibiotics.
It was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was
pulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the
superior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted
central catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her
course of intravenous vancomycin.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 491**] for cirrhosis and with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 19797**] for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4330**] next
Friday for primary care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20
mg once per day times 11 days.
 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
